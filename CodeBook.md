## Data
The data is from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

This data contains a *README.txt* file describing the data.  It states:
<pre>
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Notes:
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
</pre>

For this study, the data has been reduced:
* unwanted data was eliminated
* all data was remaining data (other than subjectID and activity) was averaged by subjectID and activity.

Units remain the same.

## Why is this data tidy?

For the first data set (Steps 1-4 in the assignment)
* (Each variable you measure is in one column): The original data set was in this format and this was maintained throughout the processing.
* (Each different observation of a variable is in a different row) The original data set contains one experiment per record.  This is maintained throughout the processing. 

For the second data set. (Step 5)
* Rows were unchanged
* Columns are derived by averaging existing columns.  This reduces the number of columns.

## Transformations

The following is an outline of the algorithm used.  For full details please see
attached script.  It is well commented.

### For each dataset (test/train)
1. The data was loaded
2. All column names which included the word "mean" or "std" were retained, all others   were dropped.
3. The appropriate subject ID was appended to each row
4. The appropriate activity ID was appended to each row
5. The dataset was merged into the final raw data set.

## After the final raw dataset was constructed
1. The *aggregate* command was run to produce the final desired table.
2. Minor cleanup was performed
3. The file was saved.
## Variables (Data Dictionary)

###The following data is unchanged from the original data set.
* subjectID: identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* activity: activity label.  Values described above.

### The following data is unchanged in the first dataset and is  the average of each variable for each activity and each subject of the original data in the second.

## Verification

I tested this by loading the data into Excel and creating a pivot table.  Values for the data was spot checked.
